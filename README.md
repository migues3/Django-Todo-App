# Django-Todo-Website
This webapp is a basic todo list for users to list the things that they need to do! I used Django to power the website, bootstrap and css to stylize it, and of course html. Note that this webapp is not active since its not production ready. This webapp was created to learn about django and web development.

# How it works
When a user first visits the webapp they will be greeted with the homepage, shown below, where thier Todo list resides. The user will need register before adding anything to their Todo list. The user needs to register in order to save thier Todo list so that they can come back later to work on their list.

# Things that can be added:
- Password resets for users who have forgotten their password
- Invitation/Remind feature: Users would be able to invite/remind others about a todo such as an event they are attending.

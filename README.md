# Django-Todo-Website
This website is a basic todo list for users to list the things that they need to do! I used Django to power the website, bootstrap and css to stylize it, and of course html. 

# How it works

# Things that can be added:
- Password resets for users who have forgotten their password
- Invitation/Remind feature: Users would be able to invite/remind others about a todo such as an event they are attending.
